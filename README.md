# Sales Forecasting Project

## Overview
This project builds a sales prediction model for retail items using machine learning. It processes sales data, performs feature engineering, and evaluates multiple regression models (Linear, Ridge, Random Forest) to forecast item outlet sales, aiding inventory and demand planning.

## Features
- Data cleaning: Imputation for missing values, standardization of categories.
- Feature engineering: Outlet age, item type categorization, average sales per outlet.
- Encoding and scaling for model compatibility.
- Model comparison with RÂ² and RMSE metrics.
- Visualization of predictions vs. actual sales.
